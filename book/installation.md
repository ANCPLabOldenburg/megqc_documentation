# Installation Guide
Now that we have a general understanding of MEGqc and its Metrics reports, this section will guide you through the installation of MEGqc. As we mentioned earlier, MEGqc can be used via **graphical user interface (GUI)** or **command-line interface (CLI)**.  Each of them have a different installation method:

* **[GUI Installation guide](../installation/gui.md)**: ideal for beginners or users who prefer a visual interface. 
* **[CLI installation guide](../installation/cli.md)**: recommended for developers or advanced users. Requires Python 3 and works via `pip`. 


```{admonition} Virtual Environments
:class: important

We strongly recommend using MEGqc within a **virtual environment** to avoid conflicts with system dependencies.
The GUI installer  automatically creates and manages a virtual environment. Meanwhile the CLI setup requires you to create one manually.
