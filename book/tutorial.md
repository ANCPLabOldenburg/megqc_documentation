# MEGqc tutorial

In this section we will explain you how to run MEGqc in your dataset. MEGqc has two main modules: the **calculation module** and the **plotting module**.
* In the **calculation module** you configure the file paths, specify parameters and execute the calculations.
* The **plotting module** uses the machine-readable outputs (JSON files and TSV files) to generate the [HTML reports](./report).
* There is a third module, the **GQI module**, which allows to re-calculate the GQI with different weight and thresholds parameters without re-running the calculation module.

Each time you run the calculation module or the GQI module, it generates a new `summary reports` folder. This folder contains a summary of metrics and GQI values of your dataset. Every run creates a new summary report folder, stored as a numbered `attempt`.

```{dropdown} Summary Reports content

The `summary reports` folder contains the following content:
* config: it will contain the settings used for each `attempt`.
* group_metrics: Includes the TSV files and a PNG plot of the GQI distribution for each `attempt`.
* global_quality_index_n = A folder for each attempt *(n = number of attempt)*, containing one subfolder per subject. These subfolders include GQI scores and the outputs of individual metrics. 

```

Here you can find how to use both modules for each version of MEGqc:
