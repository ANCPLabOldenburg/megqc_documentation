# MEGqc tutorial

In this section we will explain you how to run MEGqc in your dataset, how to create the HTML reports and more about the summary reports.

MEGqc has two main modules (the `calculation module` and the `plotting module`) which can be used via `command-line interface (CLI)` or a `graphical user interface (GUI)`. Below you will find links to the tutorials for both modules and  both modalities.

```{admonition} The calculation module
The calculation module gives you machine-readable outputs (JSON files and TSV files) for every subject and selected **metric**. For that you need to configure the file paths, specify parameters and execute the calculations.
1. [Running the calculation module for GUI](../tutorial/calc_gui)
2. [Running the calculation module for CLI](../tutorial/calc_cli)
``` 
```{admonition} The plotting module
:class: tip

The plotting module uses the machine-readable outputs of the calculation module to generate the [HTML reports](./report).

2. [Running the plotting module for CLI](../tutorial/plot_cli)
``` 

## Summary reports and the GQI module
Once you run the calculation module, MEGqc generates the `summary reports` folder. The `summary reports` folder contains a series of reports with the summary of metrics outcome and the [Global Quality Index (GQI)](../extra/gqi) values of each participant of your dataset. This folder can be found within the derivatives folder of your dataset.

```bash
path\to\your\dataset\derivatives\Meg_QC\summary_reports
```
```{admonition} The GQI module

MEGqc offers a third module, the **GQI module**, which allows to re-calculate the GQI with different parameters *(more about the parameters within the tutorial)* without re-running the calculation module. 
1. [Running the GQI module for GUI](../tutorial/gqi_gui.md)

```

Each time you re-run the GQI module, you will find the new `attempt` within the summary reports folder. The summary reports folder contains the following subfolder and files:
* **config:** it will contain the specific settings used for the GQI calculation. Each `attempt` creates a new settings file.
* **group_metrics:** Includes a TSV file and a PNG plot of the GQI distribution of the dataset. Each `attempt` creates a new pair of TSV and PNG files.
* **global_quality_index_n:** A folder containing one subfolder per subject. These subfolders include a JSON file with the outputs of individual metrics and the GQI scores. Each attempt creates a whole new folder _(n = number of attempt)_.

In case you don't have a BIDS compliant MEG dataset, hereâ€™s how to download one from OpenNeuro:
