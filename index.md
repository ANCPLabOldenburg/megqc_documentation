# Welcome!

Hello everyone, and welcome to this MEGqc documentation.
[**MEGqc**](https://github.com/ANCPLabOldenburg/MEGqc) is a Python-based pipeline for quality control of MEG data. It was developed by the [**Applied Neurocognitive Psychology Lab (ANCP Lab)**](https://uol.de/en/applied-neurocognitive-psychology).

## This guide includes
- [What is MEGqc and why do we need it?](book/introduction.md)
- [Overview of MEGqc reports](book/metrics.md)
- [Installation guide](book/installation.md)
- [Tutorial on how to run MEGqc](book/tutorial.md)

## Requirements for this tutorial
MEGqc is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. This documentation will help you to install and run MEGqc without a deep technical knowledge. Still, you might benefit from having some familiarity with the following:

- Basic knowledge of the [BIDS structure](extra/bids.md)
- Access to a Linux terminal/shell and basic [BASH commands](https://peerherholz.github.io/Python_for_Psychologists_Winter2021/introduction/intro_to_shell.html)
- Some familiarity with GitHub

```{warning}

Currently, MEGqc runs smoothly on Linux. but a Windows-compatible version is under development! ðŸš€

```

## I've got a question!

If you have any questions or encounter difficulties while working with MEGqc, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with us. You can send an e-mail to karel.mauricio.lopez.vilaret@uni-oldenburg.de or check a `New Issue` in the [MEGqc github](https://github.com/ANCPLabOldenburg/MEGqc/issues).
