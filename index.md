# Welcome!

Hello everyone, and welcome to this MEGqc tutorial.
[**MEGqc**](https://github.com/ANCPLabOldenburg/MEGqc) is a Python-based pipeline for quality control of MEG data. It was developed as **Evgeniia Gapontseva's Master Thesis (2023)** within the [**Applied Neurocognitive Psychology Lab (ANCP Lab)**](https://uol.de/en/applied-neurocognitive-psychology).

## This guide includes
- What is MEGqc and why do we need it?
- Overview of MEGqc reports
- How to install MEGqc and run it on your MEG dataset

## Requirements for this tutorial
MEGqc is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. This tutorial will help you to install it without deep technical knowledge. Still, you might benefit from having some familiarity with the following:

- MEG data basics and BIDS structure
- Access to a Linux terminal/shell
- Basic BASH commands (like ls and cd)
- Some familiarity with GitHub
